Hello Guys,
I have created this small port scanner using Python. Currently, this port scanner is limited to scanning only 1000 ports range but with a fast scan.

This is Pscanner v1.0, As much as I'll go deep in python, I'll update this tool with more features like port-range, OS Info, etc.

I am new to this, please feel free to suggest any changes or future updates.
